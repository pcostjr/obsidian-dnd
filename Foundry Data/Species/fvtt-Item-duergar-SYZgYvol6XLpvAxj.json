      "value": "<p>Duergar are dwarves whose ancestors were transformed by centuries living in the deepest places of the Underdark. That chthonic realm is saturated with strange magical energy, and over generations, early duergar absorbed traces of it. They were further altered when mind flayers and other Aberrations invaded and performed horrific experiments on them. Fueled by Underdark magic, those experiments left early duergar with psionic powers, which have been passed down to their descendants. In time, they liberated themselves from their aberrant tyrants and forged a new life for themselves in the Underdark and beyond.</p><p class=\"indent\">Like other dwarves, duergar typically have a life span of 350 years.</p><h4>DUERGAR TRAITS</h4><p>You have the following racial traits.</p><p class=\"indent\"><em><strong>Ability Score Increases.</strong></em> When determining your characterâ€™s ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.</p><p class=\"indent\"><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.</p><p class=\"indent\"><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a Humanoid.
