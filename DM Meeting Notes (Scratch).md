# Final Words
___
**Start players out at level 2.**

**Core Concept:** 
The DMs will play as "Old Gods" who are seeking the rebirth of the world in their image. These old gods manipulate the multiverse through a clandestine organization.

This organization employs significant players from the multiverse as "extraplanar mercenaries." These individuals are sought after for their potential to be powerful allies, threats, etc. 

While wishing to achieve the ultimate goal of restructuring the natural order, the gods are still petty and power-hungry. Sometimes, their goals will interfere with eachother in favor of increasing the influence of one god over the other. 

**Artifacts & Contracts:**
The main method of achieving this apocalyptic event will be through the acquisition of several artifacts that, when finally brought together, will achieve the end of the world. The players will not know this in the beginning of the campaign, but may eventually be clued in as the end draws near.

A contract campaign need not always be about the acquisition of a specific artifact. It can be a piece of information, stopping a team from taking the artifact, resistance, etc.

**NOTE:** This is also a general "throughline" for a series of disconnected campaigns using the same characters. Not every single campaign needs to be a means to an end for these items. An event or contract could be anything deemed important by the old god (and by extension the DM) issuing it.

**Player Progression:**
Generally, players should follow the same level progression, but the ad-hoc nature of campaigns can cause some variance in progression...

**Death:** Players should feel threatened by the danger or difficulty of contracts but shouldn't be punished completely by permanently losing their character. DMs can create instances for resurrection of characters that best fit the progression and narrative at current time...

**Player Leveling:** Some players who are not regularly in events should be "brought up to snuff" via a "pact" with the old gods. These pacts can offer a benefit, be it levels, gear, stat increases, etc. If a player succeeds the task set out by the pact, they keep that progression. If not, they can potentially have that benefit revoked, *or worse*.

**Extraplanar "currency":** As an additional progression schema, players can obtain benefits from the olds gods (or the clandestine organization) specifically. Unsure specifically of what to do, but players can spend "favors" to obtain benefits they normally wouldn't get from the worlds the contracts take place in.
